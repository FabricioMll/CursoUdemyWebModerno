<p>Since your URL is relative (it's just "hi.txt"), 
    it's resolved against the URL of the page the 
    code is running in. In your case, that appears 
    to be file:///something — that is, a file you've 
    loaded directly from your file system, not by 
    requesting it from a server. Chrome doesn't allow 
    fetching from the file scheme.
    <blockquote cite="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69144759/fetch-api-cannot-load-url-scheme-file-is-not-supported">Vai 
        dividir o parágrafo para fazer uma citação 
        direta e longa. hi you are running your file 
        like this way -you are right clicking on your
         html file-opening with it browser. This way 
         you are telling to browser to open your html 
          from your file location where you have saved it.
          Check in Your browser url bar you will get 
          something like this C:/xampp/htdocs/xyz.html so 
          this is your local directory file system. so now 
           have to first start your sever such as xampp or 
           whatever server you have installed and then you 
           type this localhost/filename or /subfolder nam
           nd / file name if you have stored it in subfolder
           ...and hit enter.inshort you have to query to a 
           server like you does in php file calling</blockquote> The file scheme's 
    origin is null. The Chrome team's interpretation 
    of the Same Origin Policy is that no origin, not 
    even itself, should match null. (A reasonable 
    interpretation in my view, but opinions can vary.)</p>
